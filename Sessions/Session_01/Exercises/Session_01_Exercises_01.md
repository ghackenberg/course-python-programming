## Section 1: Programming Fundamentals

### Question 1.1: What is Programming?
In your own words, define what programming is and what its primary goal is.

### Question 1.2: Interpreted vs. Compiled Languages
Explain the key differences between interpreted and compiled programming languages. Provide one example of each.

### Question 1.3: Problem-Solving Approach
List and briefly describe the five steps of the problem-solving approach discussed in the lecture.

## Section 2: Python Basics

### Question 2.1: Why Python?
List at least three reasons why Python is a popular choice for programming, as discussed in the lecture.

### Question 2.2: The Zen of Python
What is "The Zen of Python"? Name two of its key principles.

## Section 3: Environment Setup

### Question 3.1: Python Installation Verification
You have just installed Python. What command would you run in your terminal to verify that the installation was successful and to check the Python version?

### Question 3.2: Virtual Environments
Explain the purpose of a virtual environment (`venv`) in Python development. Provide the terminal commands to:
1.  Create a new virtual environment named `my_project_env`.
2.  Activate this virtual environment on a Windows system.

### Question 3.3: Running a Python Script
You have a Python file named `my_script.py` in your current directory. What command would you use in the terminal to execute this script?

## Section 4: Variables and Data Types

### Question 4.1: Variable Naming Rules
Which of the following are valid Python variable names? For invalid names, explain why.
- `my_variable`
- `1st_variable`
- `_privateVar`
- `my-variable`
- `class`

### Question 4.2: Identify Data Types
For each of the following Python expressions, identify its data type:
- `100`
- `3.14`
- `"Hello, World!"`
- `True`
- `[1, 2, 3]` (Hint: This is a list, a type of collection)

### Question 4.3: Type Conversion
Write Python code to perform the following type conversions:
1.  Convert the string `"42"` to an integer.
2.  Convert the integer `15` to a float.
3.  Convert the float `9.99` to a string.

### Question 4.4: Arithmetic Operators
What will be the output of the following Python code snippets?
1.  `print(15 // 4)`
2.  `print(15 % 4)`
3.  `print(2 ** 5)`
4.  `print(10 + 5 * 2)`
5.  `print((10 + 5) * 2)`

## Section 5: Input and Output

### Question 5.1: `print()` Function Parameters
Write a Python program that prints the words "Python", "is", "awesome!" on a single line, separated by hyphens, and ending with an exclamation mark followed by a newline.

### Question 5.2: Interactive Program
Write a Python program that asks the user for their favorite animal and then prints a personalized message using an f-string. For example, if the user enters "dog", the output should be: "That's great! I love dogs too!"

### Question 5.3: Simple Calculator
Write a Python program that:
1.  Asks the user to enter two numbers.
2.  Converts these inputs to appropriate numerical types (e.g., `float`).
3.  Calculates their sum, difference, product, and quotient.
4.  Prints all four results in a clear, formatted way (e.g., using f-strings).
