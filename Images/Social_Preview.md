# Social Preview (Prompt)

A highly detailed, professional, and modern social media preview image for a GitHub repository titled 'Programming with Python'. The image should have a 16:9 aspect ratio, ideal for social media sharing.

**Central Focus:** A prominent, stylized Python logo (the two intertwined blue and yellow snakes) positioned slightly to the left of the center. The logo should exhibit a subtle 3D effect with soft, internal illumination, making it visually pop against the background.       

**Background:** A sophisticated, abstract background that seamlessly blends elements of technology and higher education. On the right side, a blurred, minimalist representation of a modern university campus building or a stylized, geometric interpretation of the University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria (FH OOE) logo, rendered in muted, complementary shades of deep blue and teal. Throughout the background, faint, glowing lines of abstract Python code snippets or circuit board traces subtly weave, suggesting innovation, logic, and the digital realm. The overall color scheme is professional and inviting, dominated by deep blues, teals, and subtle grays, with vibrant accents of Python's signature yellow and a brighter blue.

**Foreground/Overlays:**
* Main Text Overlay: In a clean, contemporary sans-serif typeface (e.g., Montserrat, Lato), the title "Programming with Python" is clearly displayed in a crisp white or light contrasting color, positioned elegantly above or slightly to the right of the Python logo.
* Secondary Text Overlay: Below the main title, in a slightly smaller font, "FH OOE" or "University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria" is subtly placed, indicating the academic context.
* Subtle Contextual Elements: In the bottom-left corner, a very subtle, partially visible icon representing product management (e.g., a minimalist gear icon, a simplified flowchart segment, or an abstract user interface wireframe sketch) is integrated, hinting at the course's specific focus without cluttering the main composition.

**Lighting and Mood:** Soft, ambient lighting with a distinct glow emanating from the Python logo and the background code lines, creating a sense of depth, dynamism, and professionalism. The overall mood is inspiring, educational, innovative, and forward-thinking.

**Art Style:** Digital painting, concept art, clean vector graphics with subtle photorealistic textures, high detail, sharp focus on the central elements, volumetric lighting, and a cinematic quality.
